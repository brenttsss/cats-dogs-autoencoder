## Introduction
A brief description of the project, its purpose, and why it exists. Explain what problem it solves and who it's for.

## Features
- **Feature 1**: Train a CNN autoencoder model using images of cats and dogs.
- **Feature 2**: Test the model by supplying images of cats and dogs, then regenerate the images using the model.
- **Feature 3**: Use the autoencoder for unsupervised classification of cats and dogs.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
For Tensorflow to work correctly with the version I used (2.10) with GPU support, install the libraries described in requirements.txt.
